# Building Your DeFi Empire  
In the project, we will learn how to set up our own EVM Subnet on Avalanche, which is an excellent starting point for building your DeFi Kingdom.
# Description
In the document u you will find a detailed procedure on how to create your own custom Subnet and Deploy it using the Avalanche CLI. We then connect this subnet to your MetaMask wallet by giving the correct RPC URl and the other details. Once the subnet is created we can use it to dploy two smart contracts on remix and interact with it.
Note that, the Avalanche CLI does not get installed on some networks, as the network provider might have blocked it.
To access and run your Solana code on remix u may use this link to open Remix : https://remix.ethereum.org/ .
